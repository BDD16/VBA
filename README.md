# Gauss Pivot
Is a row reduction algorithm used to solve a set of linear equations
What essentially is happening is you are solving the matrix and putting in 
reduced row echelon form.  To reach reduced row ecehlon form, 
Gauss pivoting or Gauss elimination as the full process is known is the technique used.
Echelon form is when in each non-zero row, the first element is 1.

Therefore this spreadsheet contains a macro where, if possible, will put a matrix into 
reduced row echelon form, which is equivalent to solving a linear set of equations if you
choose to have that meaning.  Else, it's just putting a matrix into reduced row echelon form.
